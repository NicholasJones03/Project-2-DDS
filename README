Abalone Age Prediction: Comprehensive Regression Analysis
Project Overview
This repository contains a complete machine learning pipeline for predicting abalone age from physical measurements. The project employs rigorous statistical testing, multiple normalization techniques, and advanced regression models to identify the optimal configuration for accurate age estimation.

Problem Statement
Predicting abalone age directly from measurements is challenging because:

Age determinism: Ring count +1.5 requires destructive sampling

Non-linear relationships: Physical measurements don't scale linearly with age

Feature interactions: Combinations of measurements matter more than individual predictors

Data heterogeneity: Different abalones follow different growth patterns

This analysis systematically evaluates different modeling approaches to find the best solution.

Data & Features

Target Variable: Age (number of rings, proxy for years)

Predictors (8 features):

Sex: Categorical (Male, Female, Infant)

Length: mm (shell length)

Diameter: mm (shell diameter)

Height: mm (shell height)

Whole_weight: grams (total weight)

Shucked_Weight: grams (meat weight)

Viscera_Weight: grams (gut weight)

Shell_Weight: grams (shell alone weight)

Methodology
Phase 1: Exploratory Data Analysis
Correlation analysis with Age (Pearson correlation)

Chi-square tests for categorical significance

Variable ranking by predictive strength

Feature distribution visualization

Phase 2: Model Architecture Testing
Tested 16+ model configurations:

Simple models (1-2 predictors)

Component-based models (dimensional vs. weight measurements)

Full models (all 8 features)

Filtered datasets (binary sex classification)

Best baseline model: All variables, full dataset → MAE: 1.495 years

Phase 3: Normalization Comparison
Applied 5 normalization techniques to all models:

Z-Score
Raw Data
Min-Max
Unit Scaling
Raw Data

Phase 4: Advanced Regression Models
Trained with 100-fold Repeated Cross-Validation:

Multiple Linear Regression (MLR)

Ridge Regression

Lasso Regression

Elastic Net

Results: 20 model-normalization combinations evaluated

Phase 5: Leave-One-Out Cross-Validation (LOOCV)
Applied rigorous LOOCV for final validation:

Tested all 5 normalization methods with MLR

Runtime: ~20 minutes (32GB RAM system)

Provides theoretical performance ceiling

Important Insights
All variables matter: Removing features hurt accuracy

Initial hypothesis (selective features) rejected

All 8 predictors contribute to prediction

Feature interactions dominate: Simple models underperform

Dimensionless ratios less predictive than raw measurements

Complex relationships require regularization

Normalization effects are subtle (~0.5% variance)

Most methods perform similarly

[Best method] shows marginal advantage

Regularization helps slightly:

Ridge/Lasso marginally outperform MLR

Feature collinearity is modest (slight shrinkage benefits)

Computational Requirements
Task	Method	Time	Resources
EDA & Baseline	Simple CV	5 min	2 GB RAM
Phase 4 Models	RepeatedCV 100x1	30-45 min	8 GB RAM
Phase 5 LOOCV and XGB  >40 min	32 GB RAM
Note: sections marked with 🚨 are computationally intensive. Recommended for reference only—Phase 4 results are sufficient for practical deployment.

Performance Metrics
MAE (Mean Absolute Error): Primary metric (years of error)

RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error): Penalizes large errors

R² (Coefficient of Determination): Variance explained
